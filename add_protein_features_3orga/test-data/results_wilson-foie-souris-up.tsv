The hnRNP particle arrangement on nascent hnRNA is non-random and sequence-dependent and serves to condense and stabilize the transcripts and minimize tangling and knotting. Packaging plays a role in various processes such as transcription, pre-mRNA processing, RNA nuclear export, subcellular location, mRNA translation and stability of mature mRNAs.

P61327	MGN_MOUSE	Protein mago nashi homolog	 146	17,164	Chain (1); Modified residue (1)	NA	NA	NA	NA	FUNCTION: Core component of the splicing-dependent multiprotein exon junction complex (EJC) deposited at splice junctions on mRNAs. The EJC is a dynamic structure consisting of core proteins and several peripheral nuclear and cytoplasmic associated factors that join the complex only transiently either during EJC assembly or during subsequent mRNA metabolism. The EJC marks the position of the exon-exon junction in the mature mRNA for the gene expression machinery and the core components remain bound to spliced mRNAs throughout all stages of mRNA metabolism thereby influencing downstream processes including nuclear mRNA export, subcellular mRNA localization, translation efficiency and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). The MAGOH-RBM8A heterodimer inhibits the ATPase activity of EIF4A3, thereby trapping the ATP-bound EJC core onto spliced mRNA in a stable conformation. The MAGOH-RBM8A heterodimer interacts with the EJC key regulator PYM1 leading to EJC disassembly in the cytoplasm and translation enhancement of EJC-bearing spliced mRNAs by recruiting them to the ribosomal 48S preinitiation complex. Involved in the splicing modulation of BCL2L1/Bcl-X (and probably other apoptotic genes); specifically inhibits formation of proapoptotic isoforms; the function is different from the established EJC assembly (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.

VASP promotes actin filament elongation. It protects the barbed end of growing actin filaments against capping and increases the rate of actin polymerization in the presence of capping protein. VASP stimulates actin filament elongation by promoting the transfer of profilin-bound actin monomers onto the barbed end of growing actin filaments. Plays a role in actin-based mobility of Listeria monocytogenes in host cells. Regulates actin dynamics in platelets and plays an important role in regulating platelet aggregation (By similarity). {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10660044}.	PTM: Major substrate for cAMP-dependent (PKA) and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) in platelets. The preferred site for PKA is Ser-153, the preferred site for PKG, Ser-235. In ADP-activated platelets, phosphorylation by PKA or PKG/PRKG1 on Ser-153 leads to fibrinogen receptor inhibition. Phosphorylation on Thr-274 requires prior phosphorylation on Ser-153 and Ser-235. In response to phorbol ester (PMA) stimulation, phosphorylated by PKC/PRKCA. In response to thrombin, phosphorylated by both PKC and ROCK1. Phosphorylation at Thr-274 by AMPK does not require prior phosphorylation at Ser-153 or Ser-235. Phosphorylation at Ser-153 by PKA is required for localization to the tight junctions in epithelial cells. Phosphorylation modulates F-actin binding, actin filament elongation and platelet activation. Phosphorylation at Ser-318 by AMPK also alters actin filament binding. Carbon monoxide (CO) promotes phosphorylation at Ser-153, while nitric oxide (NO) promotes phosphorylation at Ser-153, but also at Ser-235. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10085070, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10882740, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12372613, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21945940}.

Remains associated with spliced mRNA after splicing which probably involves interactions with the exon junction complex (EJC). Can trigger mRNA decay which seems to be independent of nonsense-mediated decay involving premature stop codons (PTC) recognition. May be involved in nuclear mRNA decay. Involved in regulation of signal-induced alternative splicing. During splicing of PTPRC/CD45 is proposed to sequester phosphorylated SFPQ from PTPRC/CD45 pre-mRNA in resting T-cells. Involved in cyclin-D1/CCND1 mRNA stability probably by acting as component of the SNARP complex which associates with both the 3'end of the CCND1 gene and its mRNA. Involved in response to DNA damage. Is excluced from DNA damage sites in a manner that parallels transcription inhibition; the function may involve the SNARP complex. Initially thought to play a role in transcriptional coactivation through its association with the TRAP complex; however, it is not regarded as a stable Mediator complex subunit. Cooperatively with HELZ2, enhances the transcriptional activation mediated by PPARG, maybe through the stabilization of the PPARG binding to DNA in presence of ligand. May play a role in the terminal stage of adipocyte differentiation. Plays a role in the positive regulation of the circadian clock. Acts as a coactivator of the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer and promotes its transcriptional activator activity and binding to circadian target genes (PubMed:24043798). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23525231, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24043798}.

Essential pre-mRNA splicing factor required early in spliceosome formation and for splicing catalytic step II, probably as a heteromer with NONO. Binds to pre-mRNA in spliceosome C complex, and specifically binds to intronic polypyrimidine tracts. Involved in regulation of signal-induced alternative splicing. During splicing of PTPRC/CD45, a phosphorylated form is sequestered by THRAP3 from the pre-mRNA in resting T-cells; T-cell activation and subsequent reduced phosphorylation is proposed to lead to release from THRAP3 allowing binding to pre-mRNA splicing regulatotry elements which represses exon inclusion. Interacts with U5 snRNA, probably by binding to a purine-rich sequence located on the 3' side of U5 snRNA stem 1b. May be involved in a pre-mRNA coupled splicing and polyadenylation process as component of a snRNP-free complex with SNRPA/U1A. The SFPQ-NONO heteromer associated with MATR3 may play a role in nuclear retention of defective RNAs. SFPQ may be involved in homologous DNA pairing; in vitro, promotes the invasion of ssDNA between a duplex DNA and produces a D-loop formation. The SFPQ-NONO heteromer may be involved in DNA unwinding by modulating the function of topoisomerase I/TOP1; in vitro, stimulates dissociation of TOP1 from DNA after cleavage and enhances its jumping between separate DNA helices. The SFPQ-NONO heteromer binds DNA. The SFPQ-NONO heteromer may be involved in DNA non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) required for double-strand break repair and V(D)J recombination and may stabilize paired DNA ends; in vitro, the complex strongly stimulates DNA end joining, binds directly to the DNA substrates and cooperates with the Ku70/G22P1-Ku80/XRCC5 (Ku) dimer to establish a functional preligation complex. SFPQ is involved in transcriptional regulation. Functions as transcriptional activator (By similarity). Transcriptional repression is mediated by an interaction of SFPQ with SIN3A and subsequent recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDACs). The SFPQ-NONO-NR5A1 complex binds to the CYP17 promoter and regulates basal and cAMP-dependent transcriptional activity. SFPQ isoform Long binds to the DNA binding domains (DBD) of nuclear hormone receptors, like RXRA and probably THRA, and acts as transcriptional corepressor in absence of hormone ligands. Binds the DNA sequence 5'-CTGAGTC-3' in the insulin-like growth factor response element (IGFRE) and inhibits IGF-I-stimulated transcriptional activity (By similarity). Regulates the circadian clock by repressing the transcriptional activator activity of the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer. Required for the transcriptional repression of circadian target genes, such as PER1, mediated by the large PER complex through histone deacetylation (PubMed:21680841, PubMed:22966205).

PTM: Phosphorylated on multiple serine and threonine residues during apoptosis (By similarity). Phosphorylation of C-terminal tyrosines promotes its cytoplasmic localization, impaired its binding to polypyrimidine RNA and led to cell cycle arrest (By similarity). In resting T-cells is phosphorylated at Thr-679 by GSK3B which is proposed to promote association with THRAP and to prevent binding to PTPRC/CD45 pre-mRNA; T-cell activation leads to reduced phosphorylation at Thr-679. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P23246}.

FUNCTION: Isoform 1: Ubiquitin-protein ligase which is a core component of several complexes mainly involved in pre-mRNA splicing and DNA repair. Core component of the PRP19C/Prp19 complex/NTC/Nineteen complex which is part of the spliceosome and participates in its assembly, its remodeling and is required for its activity. During assembly of the spliceosome, mediates 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of the U4 spliceosomal protein PRPF3. Ubiquitination of PRPF3 allows its recognition by the U5 component PRPF8 and stabilizes the U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP spliceosomal complex. Recruited to RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) and the pre-mRNA, it may also couple the transcriptional and spliceosomal machineries. The XAB2 complex, which contains PRPF19, is also involved in pre-mRNA splicing, transcription and transcription-coupled repair. Beside its role in pre-mRNA splicing PRPF19, as part of the PRP19-CDC5L complex, plays a role in the DNA damage response/DDR. It is recruited to the sites of DNA damage by the RPA complex where PRPF19 directly ubiquitinates RPA1 and RPA2. 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of the RPA complex allows the recruitment of the ATR-ATRIP complex and the activation of ATR, a master regulator of the DNA damage response. May also play a role in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by recruiting the repair factor SETMAR to altered DNA. As part of the PSO4 complex may also be involved in the DNA interstrand cross-links/ICLs repair process. In addition, may also mediate 'Lys-48'-linked polyubiquitination of substrates and play a role in proteasomal degradation (PubMed:17349974).

CFIm contributes to the recruitment of multiprotein complexes on specific sequences on the pre-mRNA 3'-end, so called cleavage and polyadenylation signals (pA signals). Most pre-mRNAs contain multiple pA signals, resulting in alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) producing mRNAs with variable 3'-end formation.

MVBs contain intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that are generated by invagination and scission from the limiting membrane of the endosome and mostly are delivered to lysosomes enabling degradation of membrane proteins, such as stimulated growth factor receptors, lysosomal enzymes and lipids. The MVB pathway appears to require the sequential function of ESCRT-O, -I,-II and -III complexes. ESCRT-III proteins mostly dissociate from the invaginating membrane before the ILV is released. The ESCRT machinery also functions in topologically equivalent membrane fission events, such as the terminal stages of cytokinesis. Together with SPAST, the ESCRT-III complex promotes nuclear envelope sealing and mitotic spindle disassembly during late anaphase. ESCRT-III proteins are believed to mediate the necessary vesicle extrusion and/or membrane fission activities, possibly in conjunction with the AAA ATPase VPS4. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O43633}.

Its other ligands include G protein-coupled receptor 1 (GPR1) and chemokine receptor-like 2 (CCRL2). Positively regulates adipocyte differentiation, modulates the expression of adipocyte genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism and might play a role in angiogenesis, a process essential for the expansion of white adipose tissue. Also acts as a proinflammatory adipokine, causing an increase in secretion of proinflammatory and prodiabetic adipokines, which further impair adipose tissue metabolic function and have negative systemic effects including impaired insulin sensitivity, altered glucose and lipid metabolism, and a decrease in vascular function in other tissues. Can have both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties depending on the modality of enzymatic cleavage by different classes of proteases. Acts as a chemotactic factor for leukocyte populations expressing CMKLR1, particularly immature plasmacytoid dendritic cells, but also immature myeloid DCs, macrophages and natural killer cells. Exerts an anti-inflammatory role by preventing TNF/TNFA-induced VCAM1 expression and monocytes adhesion in vascular endothelial cells. The effect is mediated via inhibiting activation of NF-kappa-B and CRK/p38 through stimulation of AKT1/NOS3 signaling and nitric oxide production. Exhibits an antimicrobial function in the skin. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17635925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18242188}.	PTM: Secreted in an inactive precursor form, prochemerin, which is proteolytically processed by a variety of extracellular proteases to generate forms with differing levels of bioactivity. For example, the removal of six amino acids results in chemerin-156, which exhibits the highest activity, while removal of seven amino acids results in chemerin-155 which has slightly less activity. Some proteases are able to cleave at more than one site and chemerin forms may be sequentially processed by different enzymes to modulate activity levels. The coordinated expression and activity of chemerin-modifying enzymes is essential for regulating its bioactivation, inactivation and, consequently, biological function. Cathepsin G cleaves seven C-terminal amino acids from prochemerin (chemerin-155), elastase is able to cleave six (chemerin-156), eight (chemerin-154) or eleven (chemerin-151), plasmin cleaves five amino acids (chemerin-157), and tryptase cleaves five (chemerin-157) or eight (chemerin-154). Multiple cleavages might be required to fully activate chemerin, with an initial tryptase cleavage resulting in chemerin with low activity (chemerin-157), and a second cleavage by carboxypeptidase N or B producing highly active chemerin (chemerin-156) (By similarity). {ECO:0000250}.
