* Tool ID: `msconvert`


Description
-----------

msconvert from ProteoWizard.

Note: This requires manual installation of ProteoWizard, and may require a Windows environment.

See:

* <http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/>
* <http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/tools/msconvert.html>


Installing
----------

Due to potential difficulties installing ProteoWizard with vendor library support, tools for interacting with vendor types are seperated out into their own wrappers. Galaxy is generally deployed under Linux, but vendor support in ProteoWizard requires .NET 4.0. There are at least two ways to get this to work:

* Galaxy jobs may be configured to submit to a Windows host with ProteoWizard installed using the [LWR](https://wiki.g2.bx.psu.edu/Admin/Config/LWR).

* ProteoWizard can be installed under Wine. Guidance on how to set this up and package such environments for cloud deployments can be found here: <https://github.com/jmchilton/proteomics-wine-env>
