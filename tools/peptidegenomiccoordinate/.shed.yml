description: Gets genomic coordinate of peptides based on the information in mzsqlite and genomic mapping sqlite files
long_description: |
    This program loads two sqlite databases (mzsqlite and genomic mapping sqlite files) and calculates the genomic coordinates of the peptides provided as input. This outputs bed file with genomic coordinate of peptides.
    
    Input: Peptide list file, mzsqlite sqlite DB file, and genomic mapping sqlite DB file
    Output: Tabular BED file with all the columns
