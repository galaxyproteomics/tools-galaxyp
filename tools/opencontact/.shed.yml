description: OpenContact mapping for peptide mimetic discovery.
long_description: 
  OpenContact is an open source mapping algorithm for peptide mimetic discovery. 
  Peptide mimetics are short segments of functional proteins that can 
  interfere/inihibit protein-protein interactions (antagonist drugs) or 
  promote/enhance protein-protein interactions (agonist drugs).
