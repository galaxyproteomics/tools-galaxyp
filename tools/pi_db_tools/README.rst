Description
-----------
MS sample prefractionation is oftentimes done using isoelectric focusing, as each
peptide has a specific isoelectric point expressed in pI. The peptides are then
spread across a strip containing a pI gradient of a certain number of fractions. 

Here are tools that can calculate delta-pI between experimental and predicted 
or calculated pIs, as well as split a tryptic peptide database in fractions 
that match the experimental pI gradient.
