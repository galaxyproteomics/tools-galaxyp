Description
-----------
After searching and identifying spectra in a shotgun proteomics MS experiment, some steps are needed to produce output such as PSM, peptide and protein tables. MSStitch enables flexible post-production in the shape tools that enrich and modify standard identification and quant outputs. These include but are not limited to filtration, splitting, merging, etc of percolator data, adding relevant details (e.g. quant data) to PSMs, creating peptide and protein tables for multi-biological set experiments and calculating protein FDR.
