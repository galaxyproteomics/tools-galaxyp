% \maketitle
% \section{Description}
%
% The \texttt{perpage} package adds the ability to reset counters per
% page and/or keep their occurences sorted in order of appearance on
% the page.
%
% It works by attaching itself to the code for \cmd{\stepcounter} and
% will then modify the given counter according to information written
% to the |.aux| file, which means that multiple passes may be needed.
% Since it uses the internals of the \cmd{\label} mechanism, the need
% for additional passes will get announced by \LaTeX\ as ``labels may
% have changed''.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\MakePerPage}
% \begin{quote}
%   |\MakePerPage[2]{footnote}|
% \end{quote}
% will start footnote numbers with~2 on each page (the optional
% argument defaults to~1).  2~might be a strange number, unless you
% have used something like
% \begin{quote}
%   |\renewcommand\thefootnote{\fnsymbol{footnote}}|
% \end{quote}
% and want to start off with a dagger.  The starting value must not be
% less than~1 so that the counter logic can detect the reset of a
% counter
% reliably.\footnote{This unfortunately means that you can't just use
%   \cmd{\alph} in order to get figures on page~10 numbered as ``10'',
%   ``10a'', ``10b''.}
% It could be a good idea to redefine |\@cnterr| if you use a format
% with limited range: at the first pass, footnotes are not reset
% across pages and things like |\fnsymbol| will quickly run out of
% characters to use.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\theperpage}
% If you want to label things also on a per page base, for example
% with
% \begin{quote}
%   |\renewcommand{\thefigure}{\thepage-\arabic{figure}}|
% \end{quote}
% you'll have the problem that \cmd{\thepage} is updated
% asynchronously with the real page, since \TeX\ does not know which
% page the figure will end up.  If you have used the |perpage| package
% for modifying the figure counter, however, at the point where the
% counter is incremented, the macro \cmd{\theperpage} will be set to
% the correct value corresponding to the actual page location.  Note
% that this macro is shared between all counters, so advancing a
% different counter under control of |perpage| will render
% \cmd{\thefigure} incorrect.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\MakeSorted}
% \begin{quote}
%   |\MakeSorted{figure}|
% \end{quote}
% will make the |figure| counter get `sorted': this means that counter
% values will be assigned in order of appearance in the output, not in
% order of appearance in the source code.  For example, the order of
% interspersed one- and two-column figures might get mixed up by
% \LaTeX\ in the output.  Making the counter sorted will fix the order
% to match the order of appearance.  A similar problem is when
% ordinary footnotes are present in floating material (this does not
% work in standard \LaTeX, but might do so when using |manyfoot.sty|
% or |bigfoot.sty|): this might jumble their order in the output, and
% making their counter sorted will make things appear fine again.
%
% While this would not fix the order in the table of figures,
% fortunately the respective entries actually get written out in order
% of appearance in the output anyway, so this indeed fixes the
% problem.
%
% Manually setting the counter does not lead to reliable results in
% general; as a special case, however, resetting it to zero is
% recognized (this can also happen automatically when the counter is
% dependent on some other counter).  The point where it is reset in
% the source code separates `count groups': everything in the source
% before that point is assigned sorted numbers separately from
% everything appearing behind it, and the sequence numbers start again
% with~1 with the first item appearing in the output (not the source)
% from the new count group.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\MakeSortedPerPage}
% \begin{quote}
%   |\MakeSortedPerPage[2]{table}|
% \end{quote}
% will make the table numbers restart at 2 on each page \emph{and}
% will keep them sorted, to boot.  Introducing new count groups by
% resetting the counter to~0 manually will not work, as it is not
% clear how to handle count groups scattered between pages.  You will
% usually want to use something like
% \begin{quote}
%   |\renewcommand{\thefigure}{\theperpage-\arabic{figure}}|
% \end{quote}
% to go along with a page-wise figure
% number.\footnote{Note the use of \cmd{\theperpage} here, see above.}
% Note that it would be quite silly to start the ranges with~2: this
% is just an example for the optional argument in case that you ever
% need it.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\AddAbsoluteCounter}
% \begin{quote}
%   |\AddAbsoluteCounter{equation}|
% \end{quote}
% will create a counter |absequation| that will advance together with
% the counter |equation| but will not get reset along with it.  This
% is not sorted into output order, but just runs along with the
% sequence in the source file.  As a special case, the counter
% |abspage| is created in this manner and \cmd{\theabspage} is defined
% as an arabic number that works in the same contexts as \cmd{\page}
% (namely, gets properly deferred by \cmd{\protected@write}).

%ACE %   These macros are considerable tricky.  They are called as

%ACE % \def\@stpelt#1{\global\csname c@#1\endcsname \z@}

\newcommand*\MakePerPage[2][\@ne]{%

%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \begin{macro}{\MakeSorted}
%   This will create a counter sorted in appearance on the page.  No
%   optional argument is given: set the counter to a desired starting
%   value manually if you need to.  Resetting it to zero will start a
%   new count group, setting it to other values is probably not reliable.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newcommand*\MakeSorted[1]{%
  \setcounter{#1}{\z@}%
  \pp@makeperpage{#1}\c@schk@{\@ne}}
%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \begin{macro}{\MakeSortedPerPage}
%   This will create output in sorted order, reset on each page.  Use
%   an optional argument to specify the starting value per page.  This
%   must not be~0, unfortunately.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newcommand*\MakeSortedPerPage[2][\@ne]{%
  \pp@makeperpage{#2}\c@spchk@{#1}}

% \section{Internals}
%
% It works in the following manner: The basic work is done through
% attaching help code to the counter's reset list.  Each counter has
% an associated absolute id that is counted through continuously and
% is never reset, thus providing a unique frame of reference.  Sorted
% and perpage counters work by writing out information to the
% |.aux| file.
%
% The information we maintain for each counter while processing the
% source file are:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The absolute counter id.
% \item The last counter value so that we can check whether the
%   sequence has been interrupted.
% \item The current scope id.
% \item Its starting value.
% \end{itemize}
%
% The information written to the file consists of:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The absolute counter id.
% \item The current scope id.
% \item The scope's starting value.
% \item The absolute counter id of a superior counter.
% \end{itemize}
%
% Sorted counters work by writing out the current absolute id and
% range id into the |.aux| file each time the counter gets incremented.
% Whenever the counter is changed in a manner different from being
% incremented, a new counter scope gets started.  Each counter scope
% has its own independently assigned counter numbers and is associated
% with its absolute id starting value.  So as each counter is
% incremented, we write out the triple of current absolute id, counter
% scope and initial value for the scope.  Scope changes when a value
% assigned from the file differs from the `natural' value.  When the
% file is read in, counter movements are tracked.  Each counter that
% does not have its `natural' value, is having a counter setting
% recorded.
%
% The stuff works by adding a pseudo-reset counter to the counter's
% dependent counter list.
%
% \begin{macro}{\pp@makeperpage}
%   This does the relevant things for modifying a counter.  It defines
%   its reset value, it defines the correspoding absolute counter.
%   The absolute counter serves a double function: it is also used for
%   assigning numbers while reading the |.aux| file.  For this purpose
%   it is assigned the initialized values here and in the enddocument
%   hook (which is called before rereading the |.aux| file and
%   checking for changed labels), while the counter is reset to zero
%   at the start of the document.

% \begin{macro}{\pp@fetchctr}
% \begin{macro}{\theperpage}
%   This fetches the counter information and puts it into

%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
% \end{macro}
% Ok, let's put together all the stuff for the simplest case, counters
% numbered per page without sorting:
% \begin{macro}{\c@pchk@}
%   This is the code buried into to the reset list.  When the reset
%   list is executed in the context of advancing a counter, we call
%   something like
% \begin{verbatim}
%\global\c@pchk@{countername}\z@
% \end{verbatim}
%   since the reset list expected a counter here instead of some
%   generic command.  That is the reason we start off this command by
%   giving \cmd{\global} something to chew on.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\c@pchk@#1{\pp@cl@begin
%    \end{macrocode}
%   Now we fetch the page value corresponding to the not yet adjusted
%   value of the absolute counter to see whether the previous counter
%   advance happened on the same page.
%    \begin{macrocode}
  \pp@fetchctr{#1}\let\next\pp@page
  \addtocounter{pp@a@#1}\@ne
  \pp@fetchctr{#1}%
%    \end{macrocode}
%   We compare the pages for current and last advance of the counter.
%   If they differ, we reset the counter to its starting value.  We do
%   the same if the counter has been reset to zero manually, likely by
%   being in the reset list of some other counter.

% \begin{macro}{\pp@writectr}

% \begin{macro}{\c@schk@}
%   This is called for implementing sorted counters.  Sorted counters
%   maintain a ``count group'', and the values in each count group are
%   numbered independently from that of other count groups.  Whenever
%   a counter is found to have been reset, it will start a new count
%   group.  At the end of document, the count group counters need to
