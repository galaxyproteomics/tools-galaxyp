--------------------------------

Reactome software provides service of creating diagram representing the relations between the biological processes. This tool allows linking to Reactome web service with pre-loaded data from a list of IDs, a file containing IDs or from a column of a complexed file.

**For the rows that have more than 1 ID, only the first one is taken into account.**

**Supported IDs: Uniprot accession number (e.g. P01023), Entrez gene ID (e.g.7157), gene name (e.g. AQP7). If there is any ID containing invalid characters, it will be removed from the queue and placed in "Invalid identifiers" file.**
